# SQL-Week3-Practice
4/11 : So for this week I am going to attempt to use as many SQL skills I can to make a decent funciton of code.
(BTW I am looking to start a project similar to the Front End Webpage from language combination HTML JAVAScript and CSS).

4/14: Several Console Print out result isssues, still studying the basics of SQL and consulting a friend of mine for assistance as well.
Major Issue with my laptop trying to run SQL, meanwhile in a few more days I will release a major webpage update new styles and more. 

4/16: SQL is now running, for now I will just make updates to my webpage, get down all the SQL content basics, and figure out what project to work on next. 
4/16 : End Date
